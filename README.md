# DSO545-City-of-LA-homeless-Analysis



## 1、Introduction:
The goal of this project is to quantify need, demand, and potential impact of different
homelessness intervention strategies by running geospatial analysis and predictive modeling on datasets provided by the City of LA. 
The final deliverable is an online interactive dashboard that will track the current homelessness situation and the effects of existing and upcoming homelessness interventions. This dashboard will allow Mayor’s office staff to analyze data in a more holistic and standardized manner and facilitate the rapid deployment of resources and services.
This report will introduce the main datasets our group used for this project, followed by a detailed description of our methodology, analysis and insight on each dataset. It will provide readers with a brief summary of our recommendations as a result of our insights, and ends with a demonstration of our interactive dashboard.
